# Contributing To Megatron-Bridge

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Megatron-Bridge!

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Environment

### Local workstation

Megatron-Bridge uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management.

You can configure uv with the following commands:

```bash
uv sync --only-group build  # Installs build dependencies required by TransformerEngine
uv sync
```

On a machine with CUDA, you can additionally sync TE:

```bash
uv sync --extra te
```

### Alternative: Development Container

For containerized development, use our Dockerfile for building your own container. There are three flavors: `INFERENCE_FRAMEWORK=inframework`, `INFERENCE_FRAMEWORK=trtllm` and `INFERENCE_FRAMEWORK=vllm`:

```bash
docker build \
    -f docker/Dockerfile.ci \
    -t megatron-bridge \
    .
```

Start your container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -w /workdir -v $(pwd):/workdir \
  --entrypoint bash \
  --gpus all \
  megatron-bridge
```

## üì¶ Dependencies management

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing dependencies. For reproducible builds, our project tracks the generated `uv.lock` file in the repository.  
On a weekly basis, the CI attemps an update of the lock file to test against upstream dependencies.

New required dependencies can be added by `uv add $DEPENDENCY`.

New optional dependencies can be added by `uv add --optional --extra $EXTRA $DEPENDENCY`.

`EXTRA` refers to the subgroup of extra-dependencies to which you're adding the new dependency.
Example: For adding a TRT-LLM specific dependency, run `uv add --optional --extra trtllm $DEPENDENCY`.

Alternatively, the `pyproject.toml` file can also be modified directly.

Adding a new dependency will update UV's lock-file. Please check this into your branch:

```bash
git add uv.lock pyproject.toml
git commit -m "build: Adding dependencies"
git push
```

### üßπ Linting and Formatting

We use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting. CI does not auto-fix linting and formatting issues, but most issues can be fixed by running the following command:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run ruff format .
```

Note: If `ruff` is missing, please follow the [installation](#local-workstation) guide.

### üìù Documentation

**Important**: All new key features (ex: enabling a new inference optimized library, enabling a new deployment option) must include documentation update (either a new doc or updating an existing one). This document update should:

- Explain the motivation and purpose of the feature
- Outline the technical approach and architecture
- Provide clear usage examples and instructions for users
- Document internal implementation details where appropriate

This ensures that all significant changes are well-thought-out and properly documented for future reference. Comprehensive documentation serves two critical purposes:

1. **User Adoption**: Helps users understand how to effectively use the library's features in their projects
2. **Developer Extensibility**: Enables developers to understand the internal architecture and implementation details, making it easier to modify, extend, or adapt the code for their specific use cases

Quality documentation is essential for both the usability of Megatron-Bridge and its ability to be customized by the
community.

## ‚ú® Code Quality

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Do not add arbitrary defaults for configs, be as explicit as possible.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

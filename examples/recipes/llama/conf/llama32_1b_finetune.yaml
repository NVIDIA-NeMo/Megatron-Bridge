# Example YAML configuration for Llama 3.2 1B finetuning with LoRA
# This file demonstrates the most commonly customized settings.
# Uncomment and modify values as needed for your use case.

# Data configuration
data:
  # Replace with your dataset path (JSONL format recommended)
  # data_path: /path/to/your/finetuning_dataset.jsonl
  seq_length: 4096

# Training configuration
train:
  train_iters: 100
  global_batch_size: 128
  micro_batch_size: 2
  eval_iters: 10
  eval_interval: 50
  
  # Load from pretrained checkpoint
  # load: /path/to/pretrained/checkpoint

# Optimizer configuration (higher LR for LoRA)
optimizer:
  lr: 0.0001
  min_lr: 0.00001
  weight_decay: 0.0

# Learning rate scheduler
scheduler:
  lr_warmup_iters: 10
  lr_decay_style: cosine

# Checkpoint configuration
checkpoint:
  # Directory to save finetuned checkpoints
  save: ./checkpoints/llama32_1b_finetuned
  save_interval: 50

# LoRA configuration (default: rank=8, alpha=16)
peft:
  dim: 8  # LoRA rank
  alpha: 16  # LoRA alpha scaling

# For full finetuning instead of LoRA:
# peft: null
# And adjust parallelism if needed:
# model:
#   tensor_model_parallel_size: 2

# Model configuration (LoRA default: single GPU)
# Note: seq_length must match data.seq_length
model:
  seq_length: 4096
  tensor_model_parallel_size: 1
  pipeline_model_parallel_size: 1
  context_parallel_size: 1

# Logging
logger:
  log_interval: 10
  tensorboard_dir: ./logs/llama32_1b_finetuned
  # wandb_project: my_finetune_project
  # wandb_entity: my_team

# Random seed
rng:
  seed: 1234

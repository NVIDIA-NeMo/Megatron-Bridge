## Description: <br>
Resiliency features in Megatron Bridge including fault tolerance, straggler detection, in-process restart, preemption, and re-run state machine. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers enabling resiliency features (fault tolerance, hang detection, straggler detection, preemption, automatic restart) in Megatron Bridge distributed GPU training workflows. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Skill Output: <br>
**Output Type(s):** [Configuration instructions, Shell commands, Code] <br>
**Output Format:** [Markdown with inline Python and bash code blocks] <br>
**Output Parameters:** [1D] <br>
**Other Properties Related to Output:** [None] <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier Evaluation with external profile; Tier 1 ran 9 static validation checks (12 findings, overall pass), Tier 2 ran 2 deduplication checks (0 findings, pass). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

## Description: <br>
Validate and use CPU offloading in Megatron Bridge, including layer-level activation offloading and fractional optimizer state offloading with HybridDeviceOptimizer. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers enabling CPU offload to reduce GPU memory pressure during large model training, or diagnosing OOM and configuration errors related to CPU offloading in Megatron Bridge workflows. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated via NVSkills-Eval 3-Tier evaluation framework (external profile). Tier 1 static validation ran 9 checks. Tier 2 deduplication ran 2 checks. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

    """Convert data iterator into form expected by Megatron with virtual pipeline parallelism.

    With interleaved/virtual pipeline parallelism, Megatron expects a list of one data
    iterator per model chunk. Each model chunk independently gets data from its data
    iterator, so we need to interact with the data iterator multiple times for each
    microbatch step. Instead of incorporating this logic into the data loader, we cache
    the iterator's output to the first model chunk and reuse it in the other model chunks.

    Args:
        model: List of model chunks (when virtual PP is used) or single-element list
        data_iterator: Iterator yielding microbatch data

    Returns:
        If model has only 1 chunk: returns the iterator as-is
        If model has multiple chunks: returns a list of iterators with caching behavior
            - First iterator in list consumes from data_iterator and caches values
            - Remaining iterators are proxies that read from the cache

    Example:
        >>> # With virtual PP size = 2 (model has 2 chunks)
        >>> iters = make_data_iterator_list(model=[chunk1, chunk2], data_iterator=iter(microbatches))
        >>> # len(iters) == 2
        >>> # Both iters[0] and iters[1] will yield the same microbatch data
        >>> batch_from_chunk0 = next(iters[0])  # Fetches from data_iterator, caches
        >>> batch_from_chunk1 = next(iters[1])  # Reads from cache, same data
